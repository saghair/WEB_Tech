This project is for the course WEB Technologies. Practical work and class work.

It will be used for practice on html and css coding and making basic WEB pages, gaining basic skills in general about what the WEB is and how to navigate and understand to use it and benefit from it.

So far we learned about how to use the main structure of the html language and also the html tags.

we made a simple page with a table at first and learned how to make rows and colomuns. then we learned about rowspan and colspan where we can use the same value for more than one colomun or more than one row.
